        <p>Throughout my school and career life, I have been motivated by one thing: Passion. Whether it’s for movies or
          for
          technology, my passions have always driven me to become the best in my respective field. From working at Amazon
          and
          Apple, I have become well-versed in using data to drive consumption and the importance of building quality
          branded
          products. From writing automation scripts to working with numerous databases and CMS’, I knew I had a keen eye
          for
          detail and ability to adapt to different environments. Crafting a new career path in such a dynamic and
          ever-growing
          industry is incredibly exciting and I look forward to taking my first step as a Junior Developer.</p>

        <h2>General Assembly</h2>
        <h5>Web Development Immersive</h5>
        <h6>Jan 2019 – May 2019</h6>
        <p>
        General Assembly's world-renowned Web Development Immersive course was the best kickstart to my coding career possible. Covering a vast array of cutting edge subjects and technologies (such as React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, MongoDB etc.) was incredibly rewarding, giving me a fantastic fundamental understanding of the current programming landscape. Whilst it was extremely intense, I loved my time at GA. First and foremost, the best thing about the course were
        the people. Being surrounded by such talented and interesting people from different backgrounds and fields was a
        fantastic way to explore this new domain. I learnt so much from their different approaches to problems and teamwork. The
        most important thing I will take from the course is a sense of curiosity. Despite confidence in my own coding, I found
        great value in asking people’s opinion and reasoning behind their decisions as I feel this is truly the best way to
        learn.

        <h2>Apple & Amazon</h2>
        <h5>Video Content Curator and Strategist</h5>
        <h6>Oct 2012 - Jan 2019</h6>
        <p>For the past 4 years I was the Movies and TV Editor for Apple. Before that I was the Digital Video
          Content Manager for Amazon's Prime Instant Video Service. Working for 2 tech giants has taught me invaluable lessons in e-commerce and the importance of brand quality. At Apple I spearheaded various campaigns, working across multiple teams such as Design, Marketing, Operations and Editorial. A lot of these campaigns required working with our external partners and using their IPs. Through teamwork and collaboration we were able to pull off mould-breaking promotions that even garnered press attention. 
          Inspired by the company's heritage for innovation and leadership, I took it upon myself to improve a lot of the processes involved with the day-to-day running of the business, by building systems that would bring together Apple's various processes and simplify them into one cohesive platform.

            Inspired by the amazing street art in the surrounding Shoreditch area, I built Tag, a web app for graffiti lovers, which
            allows users to find street art in their local area and elsewhere, plus also share their own spots. The back end was
            built using Python, Flask and SQL - which was a completely new language and back end process for us. I implemented
            various public APIs such as Mapbox and OpenCage Geocoder to make it work seamlessly with the real world. The app’s
            front end was designed mobile first, to ensure it was as responsive as possible.

            We had just over a week to create an app that had a custom made back end by building a RESTful API and using React to
            render the front end. We created Munch, a social networking site for foodies, bringing together restaurant reviews and
            recipes all in one place. My part in the project included building the models in Node.js, building the friend request
            and pinned items functionality, implementing search, creating the initial seeds file and styling icons and buttons.

            We had to render an app that retrieves data from a public API in an interesting and engaging manner. We had just under
            48 hours to achieve this goal, making it extremely time sensitive. We chose to create a web app called The Times
            Machine, which allows users to retrieve tech news dating back to the 1920s by using the New York Times Archive API. My
            contribution included formatting the results, implementing the search form and filtering of the results to display
            relevant content - a tough task considering the inconsistent metadata that came with the API.

            An individual project built in just over a week, which was both my first game I had built and my first project using
            Vanilla JavaScript, having only been studying it for two weeks. Battle of the Wall is a Game of Thrones-themed variation
            on the classic game Battleships, a one-player game against a computer AI which intelligently hunts down the user’s
            ships.
