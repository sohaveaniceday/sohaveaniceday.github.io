        <p>Throughout my school and career life, I have been motivated by one thing: Passion. Whether it’s for movies or
          for
          technology, my passions have always driven me to become the best in my respective field. From working at Amazon
          and
          Apple, I have become well-versed in using data to drive consumption and the importance of building quality
          branded
          products. From writing automation scripts to working with numerous databases and CMS’, I knew I had a keen eye
          for
          detail and ability to adapt to different environments. Crafting a new career path in such a dynamic and
          ever-growing
          industry is incredibly exciting and I look forward to taking my first step as a Junior Developer.</p>

        <h2>General Assembly</h2>
        <h5>Jan 2019 – May 2019</h5>
        <p>Having found General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive course, I knew it was the right choice for me.
          Covering such a
          vast array of content in three months was highly appealing, as I knew I would get the best possible start to my
          new
          career. Whilst it was extremely intense, I loved my time at GA. First and foremost, the best thing about the
          course were
          the people. Being surrounded by such talented and interesting people from different backgrounds and fields was a
          fantastic way to explore this new domain. I learnt so much from their different approaches to problems and
          teamwork. The
          most important thing I will take from the course is a sense of curiosity. Despite confidence in my own coding, I
          found
          great value in asking people’s opinion and reasoning behind their decisions as I feel this is truly the best way
          to
          learn.

        <h2>Apple & Amazon</h2>
        <h5>Oct 2012 - Jan 2019</h5>
        <p>For the past 4 years I have been the Movies and TV Editor for Apple. Before that I was the Digital Video
          Content Manager for Amazon's Prime Instant Video Service. Working for 2 tech giants has taught me invaluably
          about e-commerce and the importance of brand quality. I came from a creative background and proved I could adapt to a technical environment. I built numerous systems that allowed for improved workflows, such as creating systems that would allow automation of repetitive daily tasks.
